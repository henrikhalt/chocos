    <description><![CDATA[## Windows Terminal (zip-version)

This edition of the Windows Terminal chocolatey package is an alternative to the appx-based package, based on the x64-zip published alongside the appx-version on Microsofts official Windows Terminal Github releases page https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases.

This package will focus on stability and reliability, so it can be used in automations, like packer images, ansible playbooks, dsc, etc. 

As this is a zip extraction only-install, the install is very simple and safe. 

The zip-install has a few limitations, documented by Microsoft on https://learn.microsoft.com/nb-no/windows/terminal/distributions, including:

- It will not get automatic updates
- You cannot select Windows Terminal as the default terminal application
- You don't get the "Open in Terminal" context menu item

### OS Support

This package should work on any Windows version that supports Windows Terminal, including Windows 11, Windows 10, Windows Server 2022 and Windows Server 2019. 

If you have issues starting the terminal on any of these platforms, [submit an issue on my Github](https://github.com/henrikhalt/chocos/issues), and I will add platform specific requirements.


please check the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/nb-no/windows/terminal/distributions) for troubleshooting tips.
let them know [here](https://github.com/henrikhalt/chocos/issues) that the package is no longer updating correctly.
